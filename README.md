# ðŸš€ Terraform Basics

Welcome to my Terraform learning journey! This repository contains my notes, Terraform configuration files, and key concepts as I progress through mastering Terraform. Below you'll find an introduction to the basics of Terraform, along with examples and essential commands.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my exploration of Terraform, an open-source tool by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure as code. In this stage, Iâ€™m focusing on understanding the fundamentals, such as how to write basic configurations and use essential Terraform commands.

## Terraform Configuration Files

Terraform configurations are written in `.tf` files. These files define the resources you want to create and manage in your infrastructure. Here are the key types of Terraform files you'll find in this repository:

### Key Files
- **`main.tf`:** The main configuration file where infrastructure resources are defined, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage.
- **`variables.tf`:** A file to define input variables, making configurations more flexible and reusable. Variables allow you to input values without hardcoding them into your configuration.
- **`outputs.tf`:** Defines output values that Terraform should return after running. Outputs are useful for exposing key information, such as resource IDs or IP addresses.

### Example: Basic AWS EC2 Instance

Below is an example configuration that creates an AWS EC2 instance. This example is included in the repository under `main.tf`:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

- The `provider` block specifies AWS as the cloud provider and sets the region.
- The `resource` block defines an EC2 instance with a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.

## Essential Terraform Commands

Terraformâ€™s command-line interface (CLI) is where you interact with your configurations. Below are some of the essential commands that Iâ€™ve learned to use:

- **`terraform init`:** Initializes the working directory containing the Terraform configuration files. This command downloads necessary provider plugins and sets up the environment.
- **`terraform plan`:** Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state defined in your configuration. Itâ€™s like a dry run to check for errors before making any changes.
- **`terraform apply`:** Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration. This command will prompt you to confirm before making any changes.
- **`terraform destroy`:** Destroys the infrastructure managed by Terraform. This command is useful for tearing down environments when theyâ€™re no longer needed.

## Deploying My First Resource

Using the commands listed above, I successfully deployed my first AWS EC2 instance. The process was smooth, and it was exciting to see infrastructure come to life from just a few lines of code.

## Next Steps

Iâ€™m eager to continue learning more advanced Terraform features, such as modules, state management, and remote state backends. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this journey!
